      "title": "Thermage",
      "info": "<p>Thermage is a non-invasive procedure that can help tighten and contour your skin without injections or surgery. Thermage employs radiofrequency technology to heat the deep layers of skin while keeping the top layer cool and undamaged. The heat will stimulate your body's natural collagen production, which softens and smooths skins while making it appear tighter and younger, Thermage can be used on facial wrinkles and loose skin, as well as on other areas of the body prone to skin sagging such as the stomach, buttocks, knees, legs, arms, and hands. This is the only treatment appropriate for body-shaping that BizMed Spa offers. You should begin to see results within days of treatment, and they will continually improve over the months following treatment and last up to several years.</p>"

      "info": "<p>Sometimes, all the diet and exercise in the world can still leave you with parts of your body that hold too much fat. But, liposuction might seem like an extreme solution, and many of us will avoid surgery if we can help it.<br/>If this is the case, then Smart Lipo might be right for you. Using only a local anesthetic during a 45–minute in–office procedure, we target pockets of unwanted fat with a laser, immediately dissolving the cells into fluid. This fluid is then released and drained out of your body naturally. And, the laser also stimulates collagen production, resulting in tighter, smoother skin in the treated areas.<br/>Because Smart Lipo is a non–invasive procedure, it is ideal for many areas of the body, including: Arms<br/>Breasts (male)<br/>Buttocks<br/>Chin<br/>Face<br/>Hips<br/>Thighs<br/>Come in for a consultation, and we can discuss if you're a good candidate for Smart Lipo.</p>"

      "info": "<p>LUX 1540 Fractional Laser is a dye-free skin resurfacing treatment designed to reduce the appearance of skin imperfections such as lines, wrinkles, acne scars, sun damage, hyperpigmentation, and stretch marks. The LUX 1540 delivers uniform microbeams of light into the deep layers of the skin, stimulating collagen production and healing processes that reduce damage and resurface the top layer of skin. No dye or extensive cooling process is required, so LUX 1540 treatments are more efficient and effective than other laser resurfacing alternatives. LUX 1540 treats the top layer of skin directly, as opposed to other laser treatments such as LUX V that target subsurface glands. As with all laser treatments, there is some minimal risk of swelling and redness after treatment. Sunscreen of minimum SPF 30 should always be used after laser treatments.</p>"

      "title": "LUXV-ACNE TREATMENT",
      "info": "<p>LUX V is an aesthetic laser treatment that targets overactive sebaceous glands that cause acne, resulting in a dramatic reduction in acne lesions over the course of several treatment sessions. The laser emits a wavelength of light that alters the structure of the targeted sebaceous glands and reduces acne-causing oil production without injuring the top layer of skin. LUX V treatments take about 20 minutes depending on the location and amount of areas treated, and results should last up to 6 months. LUX V laser treatment differs from LUX1540 resurfacing treatment in that it does not affect or damage the top layer of skin, but rather targets deep glands. As with all laser treatments, there is some minimal risk of swelling and redness after treatment. Sunscreen of minimum SPF 30 should always be used after laser treatments.</p>"

BizMed Spa offers three Omnilux™therapy options, and each emits a different narrow band of visible light to treat specific skin conditions: Omnilux blue™targets light-activated compounds in the skin that kill acne-causing bacteria Omnilux revive™activates cellular mechanisms responsible for tissue repair and regeneration, and helps to reduce bruising and inflammation Omnilux plus™stimulates collagen production to rejuvenate skin and heal wounds.  Your BizMed Spa clinician can shape and contour the illumination to specific treatment areas, so each are receives the required therapy dose. All three light therapies can be used in conjunction to achieve the best overall results, and can all be used safely with other skin rejuvenation treatments such as BOTOX® Cosmetic, RADIESSE®, and JUVÉDERM®.</p>"

BOTOX® Cosmetic is a prescription medication that blocks nerve impulses to the muscles between the brows, reducing wrinkle-causing muscle activity. Injections can be completed in about 10 minutes, and you should begin to see improvement in frown lines within days that may last up to 4 months. BOTOX® Cosmetic differs from injectable fillers such as RADIESSE® and JUVÉDERM® in that it targets muscles to smooth skin rather than filling wrinkles with an external substance. Due to the blocking effect of BOTOX® Cosmetic on nerve impulses, patients who have multiple sclerosis, bleeding disorders, are pregnant or nursing, or take certain medications should not have BOTOX® Cosmetic treatments.</p>"
